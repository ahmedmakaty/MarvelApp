Hi smava people, 
Hope this finds you well

How to run the application? 
1- Open the project in Android studio
2- Download sdk repos if needed
3- Run on device or emulator

The java source code is at app/src/main

I have used the mvp pattern

Marvel api keys are stored in a .properties file in the assets folder
